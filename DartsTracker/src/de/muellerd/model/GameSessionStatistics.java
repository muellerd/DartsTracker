 * This class should represent statistical data of a single game for a single player. In a session a player 
 * can either play on his own and just record his throws, or he can participate in games. Only the results of one 
 * single game will be recorded in this class.
 * If there is game with four players, there will be four individual objects (one for each player) for this particular
 * game.
